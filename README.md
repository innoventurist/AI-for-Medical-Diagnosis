<h2><strong><em> About </em></strong></h2>

<p>AI is transforming many industries, especially the medical industry. Not only is it able to find patterns in data and imaging through neural networks and NLP,
it is also able to help in the overall diagnosis and prognosis of a patient. Using AI combined with a physician's expertise, this could pave the way to bettering a
human's overall survival and creating unique alternatives of preventing disease in the field of health and healing ❤️ </p>

<p>This section specifically looks at classification and image segmentation using MRI imaging and X-rays.</p>

<h2><p><strong><em>Projects:</em></strong></p></h2>

<ul>
<li>Disease Detection with Computer Vision</li>
<li>Evaluating Models</li>
<li>Image Segmentation on MRI Images</li>
</ul>

<h2><p><strong><em>Goal:</em></strong></p></h2>

<p>Understanding how to use evaluation metrics to help the neural network model perform well on the diagnosis of disease. Also use image segmentation to be able to identify
and locate tumor in MRI imaging.</p>
